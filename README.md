# 1. Make Us Laugh

My submission is called Halloween Joke Generator. It is a web page that generates a halloween joke from selecting a joke at random from an array and displaying it on the screen when the user clicks "Generate Joke".

Files can be found inside the folder ["make-us-laugh"](https://github.com/hdunlop310/jpm-guts-code-olympics-2021/tree/main/make-us-laugh).
