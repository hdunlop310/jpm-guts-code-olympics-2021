# 1. Make Us Laugh

My submission is called Halloween Joke Generator. It is a web page that generates a halloween joke from selecting a joke at random from an array and displaying it on the screen when the user clicks "Generate Joke".

Files can be found inside the folder ["make-us-laugh"](https://github.com/hdunlop310/jpm-guts-code-olympics-2021/tree/main/make-us-laugh).


# 2. I Reject Your Reality and Substitute My Own

My submission for this challenge is a Halloween Bag Generator. The idea is that when you are creating goody bags for halloween trick or treaters, it can be hard to work out how many sweets should go in each bag to make it fair, this challenge would aim to solve this problem. The full proposal can be found [here]().
